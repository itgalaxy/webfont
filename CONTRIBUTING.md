# Contributing

This project has a [code of conduct](https://github.com/itgalaxy/webfont/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By interacting with this repository, organization, or community you agree to abide by its terms.

---

We‚Äôre excited that you‚Äôre interested in contributing! Take a moment to read the following guidelines.

There‚Äôs several ways to contribute, not just by writing code:

## Improving documentation

As a user of this project you‚Äôre perfect for helping us improve our docs: typo corrections, error fixes, better explanations, and new examples.

## Improving issues

Some [issues lack information](https://github.com/itgalaxy/webfont/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22need+more+info%22), aren‚Äôt reproducible, or are just [invalid](https://github.com/itgalaxy/webfont/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Ainvalid). Help make them easier to resolve.

## Giving feedback on issues

We‚Äôre always looking for more opinions on discussions in the issue tracker.

## Writing code

Code contributions are very welcome. It‚Äôs often good to first create an issue to report a bug or suggest a new feature before creating a pull request to prevent you from doing unnecessary work.

And, if you‚Äôre raising an issue, please understand that people involved with this project often do so for fun, next to their day job; you are not entitled to free customer service.

## Submitting an issue

- Search the issue tracker (including closed issues) before opening a new issue;
- Ensure you‚Äôre using the latest version of projects;
- Use a clear and descriptive title;
- Include as [much information as possible](https://github.com/itgalaxy/webfont/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md): steps to reproduce the issue, error message, version, operating system, etcetera;
- The more time you put into an issue, the more we will.

## Submitting a pull request

- Non-trivial changes are often best discussed in an issue first, to prevent you from doing unnecessary work;
- For ambitious tasks, you should try to get your work in front of the community for feedback as soon as possible;
- New features should be accompanied with tests and documentation;
- Please, don‚Äôt include unrelated changes;
- Lint and test before submitting code by running `$ npm test`;
- Write a [convincing description](https://github.com/itgalaxy/webfont/blob/master/.github/pull_request_template.md) of why we should land your pull request: it‚Äôs your job to convince us.
